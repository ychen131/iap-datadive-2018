      "The three organisations said they would share ideas and resources about opportunities to make solar power available throughout the region, transforming African deserts into new sources of renewable energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Desert-to-Power scheme, initiated by the AfDB, aims to develop 10,000megawatts (Mw) of solar energy across the Sahel region. It is intended to provide solar generated electricity to 250 million people, including 90 million through off grid solutions, thereby enabling the development of agriculture and other economic activities.\n",

      "GCF Executive Director, Howard Bamsey, said: “Sahel countries have identified the potential of solar power to bring green energy to people across the region. Renewable energy investment is a priority in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement.”\n",

      "“The Desert-to-Power scheme will transform countries in the Sahel region by accelerating their access to energy through solar power. To realise this ambition, strong collaboration is needed. Therefore the partnership with the Green Climate Fund and Africa50 is a great milestone and will help us deliver at scale.”\n",
      "\n",
      "CEO of Africa50, Alain Ebobissé, said: “Africa50 is about leveraging partnerships to contribute to the continent’s growth through developing and funding high impact private and PPP infrastructure projects. This agreement allows us to leverage our project development capabilities and build a bigger pipeline of bankable projects that will provide millions of people and businesses on the continent with clean and affordable energy.”\n",

      "\n",
      "The Maharashtra Project for Climate Resilient Agriculture will be implemented in rural areas largely dependent upon rainfed agriculture. The project will take up a series of activities at the farm and watershed level. It will scale up climate-resilient technologies such as micro irrigation systems, expand surface water storage, and facilitate aquifer recharge, which is expected to directly contribute to a more efficient use of scarce water resources. By adopting climate-resilient seed varieties which have short maturity, are drought and heat resistant, and salt tolerant, the project will help reduce risks of climate-related crop failure, and help enhance farmer’s income.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, climate variability has affected agriculture in Maharashtra, where farming is largely dominated by small and marginal farmers. Farmers have low crop productivity and a high dependence on rainfall. Severe drought in the past has affected the state’s agriculture performance. At the watershed level, project activities include building drainage lines and preparing catchment area treatment plans that promote a more efficient use of surface water for agriculture, complemented with a more sustainable use of groundwater, which will ultimately improve the availability and quality of water at the farm level.\n",
      "\n",
      "To strengthen emerging value chains for climate-resilient agricultural commodities, the project will improve the capacity of Farmer Producers Organisations to operate as sustainable, market-oriented, agri-enterprises.

      "India’s per capita emission of Green House Gases (GHG) is also on the rise, though current per capita levels of 2.44 tonne CO 2 equivalent in 2012, is still among the lowest in the world. In absolute terms, the agriculture sector is the second largest contributor with around 18 percent of the country’s total GHG emissions. This project will help mitigate that through carbon sequestration which involves planting trees in upper catchment areas and afforestation; growing fruit trees on small orchards; and incorporating crop residues (biomass) into the soil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking on the occasion, Joint Secretary, DEA, MoF, Khare said that the Government of India accords high priority to welfare of farmers and is implementing several schemes to revitalise the agriculture sector and improve the economic condition of farmers. To cope with climate change, agricultural systems must be resilient and adapt to change. The Project will strengthen the resilience of small and marginal farmers against adverse climate events by promoting agricultural technologies and farming practices that are aimed at improving soil health, water-use efficiency and crop productivity.\n",

This project will help the rural poor, largely dependent on rain-fed agriculture, use more climate-resilient farming technologies and conserve water, a scarce resource. The project will also support the state government to shift towards a new paradigm that puts climate resilience at the core of agricultural growth and rural development in Maharashtra.\n",

      " Guntur: In what could be a big relief from water woes, the state government has given its green signal for taking up comprehensive drinking water schemes in 10 towns in Krishna and Guntur districts.The state government has directed the municipal administration department to get the Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) ready by the end of February. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has already granted its in-principle clearance to fund the drinking water scheme and it is expected to approve the final project cost after receiving the DPRs. Nandigama, Jaggaiahpet, Tiruvuru, Pedana and Vuyyur municipalities in Krishna district and Tadepalle, Mangalagiri, Vinukonda, Macherla and Piduguralla towns in Guntur district were selected for the scheme.According to initial estimates, every town would get at least Rs 20 crore for taking up the drinking water schemes. The state has decided to revamp the existing water schemes in these towns after finding that they are unable to serve the needs of the locals. Each of these towns has a population of between 40,000-1,00,000. Sources said that all the schemes would be projected under the External Aided Projects (EAP) of the Special Package granted to the state.Sources said the state government is seriously planning to cover the comprehensive drinking water scheme in about 45 municipal towns to get maximum assistance from the Centre. As the Centre is bound to take 90 per cent cost of the projects projected under EAP under special package, the state government wanted to push as many schemes as possible through the special package.Taking the mood of the external aided agencies, which are instantly granting funds for drinking water schemes into account, the state government is planning to draw maximum number of funds to benefit more towns.Sources said that 10 towns, which were picked up for implementation of water schemes, would get at least Rs 200 crore. “We can provide drinking water connections to all households and ensure protected drinking water supply after completion of the comprehensive drinking water schemes,” municipal administration director K Kanna Babu said.At present, not even 50 per cent of households have drinking water connections. In fact, water is being supplied just for 15-30 minutes a day due to the shortage of resources.\n",

It is also mulling reducing the number of packages of the underground section from four to two to get competitive pricing from bidders.BMRCL had earlier proposed an underground section spanning 14km between Dairy Circle and Nagawara on the corridor. Sources said the length is likely to be reduced to less than 8km. However, there will not be any change in the alignment. With BBMP beginning work on widening of Bannerghatta Road , BMRCL may build an elevated line instead of the underground section. “We are now considering going for an elevated section on wider roads like Bannerghatta Road. This will reduce the project cost and help in speedy construction,” said a BMRCL official.BMRCL had split the 8.8-km underground section of the Phase 1 project into two packages and the work took almost five years to complete. Challenges that cropped up during the tunnelling work delayed the project.Bids to undergo scrutinyThe work on Nagawara and Dairy Circle line was divided into four packages to attract more bidders. The line was to be part of an extended corridor linking Nagawara to Kempegowda International Airport.Larsen & Toubro, Gulermak, Afcons Infrastructure and Italian-Thai Development have offered a package each on the Dairy Circle-Nagawara underground section. The lowest bid received by BMRCL amount to Rs 8,553 crore compared to its estimate of Rs 5,047 crore.Sources said the bids will now undergo scrutiny by the evaluation committee. BMRCL may tweak the design and packages after approval from the European Investment Bank (EIB). Reducing the number of packages will result in increased number of bidders being in the race and bring in an element of competition, they claimed.EIB and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) have committed Rs 5,786 crore loan towards the Phase II underground section.\n",

      "Passed in order to \"expedite\" land acquisition for the new Andhra Pradesh capital Amravati after the state government's \"land pooling\" scheme has come under stress , the recent amendment Bill, passed by the State Legislative Assembly tweaking crucial provisions of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (LARR) Act, 2013, is allegedly in line with the \"directions\" of the Doing Business Report of the World Bank. A civil society statement, signed by 46 organizations, has said that the Doing Business Report recommends the dilution of land acquisition procedure and other regulatory ‘bottlenecks’ in order to enhance \"investments, considering it as one of the prerequisites \"to improve its ranking on the Ease of Doing Business at the behest of international financial institutions\".\"The amendments open the doors to all kinds of projects, violating the purpose of public purpose\", the statement, signed, among others, by the National Alliance of People’s Movements, the All India Union of Forest Working People (AIUFWP), Narmada Bachao Andolan, Samata, Mines Minerals and People, says, adding, they particularly undermine LARR Act's social impact assessment, need for consent by 70% landowners are circumvented.Assented by the President of India, the amendment, says the civil society statement, \"empowers the district collector to pass an award for acquiring land after taking consent of the interested person without making an enquiry\", calling the amendments \"an insult to people who hard fought to secure progressive provisions in the LARR Act, 2013, weakening people’s power to challenge illegal and unjust forced acquisition of land.\"Pointing out that amendments \"empower the state and corporations to infringe upon people’s rights over natural resources\", the statement underlines, *In the Amravati Capital City project in Andhra Pradesh, this amendment will only embolden the efforts of the state in going ahead with the project, which involves coercion and intimidation in acquiring farmland despite pending cases, injunctions by courts and people’s protests.\"It adds, \"This is an attempt by the state to legitimise the illegal and unjust actions, and we strongly condemn it. As is being widely perceived, the inability of the state to acquire lands through its questionable ‘land pooling’ scheme in the case of Amaravati, in fact, triggered the proposal to amend the LARR Act, 2013.\"The statement further says, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has already approved lending to the Govt. of Andhra Pradesh government for the Amaravati Capital City Project, and the project is being \"co-financed by the World Bank\", even as \"farmers affected by the land-pooling scheme have taken up \"their grievances with the complaint mechanism of the World Bank in the absence of compliance mechanisms and policies of AIIB\".The statement adds, \"Whether in Amaravati or elsewhere in the country, the worst-affected due to diversion of large swathes of fertile farmlands to corporate entities, non-farm purposes, etc. would be tenant cultivators, women farmers, fisher people, forest-dwelling adivasis, especially in scheduled areas, and landless Dalits, on a massive scale, whose rights and interests the State and the President has an obligation to protect.\"\n",

      "THE African Development Bank (AfDB) has extended a three-and-a-half-year $25 million loan facility to the local private sector that will be administered through CABS.\n",
      "\n",
      "The facility is expected to help small to medium private players improve on their working capital, address liquidity constraints, cover the growing gap in foreign currency needs as well as import the much needed raw materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking at the signing ceremony in Harare yesterday which was also attended by Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) Governor Dr John Mangudya, AfDB Country Manager Damoni Kitabire noted Zimbabwe’s potential to recover from its economic past, given the framework that is being laid by the “new political and institutional dispensation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He said local industry has been affected by business confidence which has been low over the last two decades during which the sector has grappled with numerous challenges including lack of working capital, liquidity constraints, inadequate foreign currency for manufacturing companies and the continued influx of cheap imported products. “The agreement for signature for a Trade Finance Line of credit worthy $25 million with a tenure of 3,5 years is a testament to the African Development Bank’s strong commitment to Zimbabwe,” said Mr Kitabire.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It marks the beginning of a new relationship not only between the African Development Bank and CABS, but also one that we believe will potentially extend to the broader commercial banking sector in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In a nutshell, this facility will be used to provide medium term foreign currency liquidity specifically for trade finance purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The AfDB is aware of the fact that Zimbabwean financial institutions are struggling to secure trade finance lines from the international market, especially those with tenure in excess of 270 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The facility, therefore, partly mitigates this challenge by allowing CABS to on lend over a longer tenure especially in sectors where longer term trade finance funding is required, such as agriculture, infrastructure and manufacturing,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "AfDB, Mr Kitabire said, hopes the intervention will complement Government’s current efforts which seek to revitalise the economy by among other interventions, improving access to affordable credit for small to medium enterprises while supporting the country’s economic transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said the bank’s expectation is to achieve a multiplier effect whereby increased employment will stimulate demand and further enhance private sector development. CABS managing director Simon Hammond thanked AfDB for choosing Zimbabwe and channelling the fund through CABS.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This facility will no doubt go a long way in supporting our local industry including manufacturing and exporting companies as a whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "“These companies will in turn generate foreign currency and this will obviously contribute to the economic revival of Zimbabwe, something, I am sure we all want dearly.\n",

      " MANILA, PHILIPPINES (21 February 2018) — The Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved loans totaling $360 million to buy modern rolling stock and support reform in Bangladesh Railway to help promote a shift from roads to rail.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Railways in Bangladesh potentially offer a cheaper, safer, and more fuel-efficient means of transport of goods and passengers than roads, but have been held back by lack of investment and aging and unreliable rolling stock,” said Tsuneyuki Sakai, an ADB Senior Transport Specialist. “The ADB Railway Rolling Stock Operations Improvement Project will boost the operational performance of Bangladesh Railway by introducing new technology, equipment, and processes that will be cleaner and more efficient, cutting carbon dioxide emissions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Historically, railways enjoyed a monopoly as a carrier and transported most commodities. However, its market share has dropped because of inadequate investment in railway infrastructure and rolling stock over an extended period. This has resulted in unreliable freight operations and uncomfortable experiences for passengers. Most rolling stock is more than 30 years old, and much is past the end of its economic life. Maintenance facilities have also not improved over time and are not adequately equipped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under its Seventh Five-Year Plan for fiscal years 2016-2020, the government has placed special emphasis on railway development, setting targets to increase the market share to 15% in freight transport and 10% in passenger movements by 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bangladesh Railway has also been operating at a loss, its operating costs about double what it makes from revenue. Under the railway reform supported by ADB, the government has taken steps to boost revenue by raising the level of passenger and freight tariffs that have remained unchanged for decades. An increase in the operational capacity through new rolling stock is needed to generate more revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with a Railway Sector Improvement Program in 2006, ADB has provided four loans to the government for railway development totaling $2.81 billion. Three loans invested in network improvement in key sections of the railway, with two targeting enhanced South Asian subregional connectivity. The Railway Reform Project under the 2006 program introduced financial reforms and an enterprise resource planning information technology (IT) system. A loan approved in 2015 is also procuring rolling stock and maintenance equipment, for which work is ongoing to 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "This latest project seeks to address the investment and modernization needs of Bangladesh Railway. It will procure 40 broad gauge locomotives, 125 luggage vans, and 1,000 wagons for freight trains for use on major lines of the rail network. The rolling stock will introduce auxiliary power units (APU) to Bangladesh Railway, to significantly reduce diesel consumption when the locomotives are idling. The project will also draw up investment plans for urgently required maintenance facilities, establish training programs for the drivers, and run the enterprise-wide IT system.\n",
      "\n",
      "The total cost of the project is $453.37 million, of which $93.37 will be met by the government. It is due for completion around the end of June 2022.\n",

      "Accompanying the loans is a technical assistance grant of $500,000 to devise a training scheme for drivers in the use of the APU and recommend potential approaches to achieving overall energy efficiency.

The growth in these 10 years averaged about 6.3% and reached 7.3% in 2017. This high economic growth has enabled Bangladesh to attain middle-income status in July 2015 and helped cut poverty from about 49% in 2000 to 24% in 2016.\n",

      "Mr. Nakao noted that Bangladesh is on track to continue its growth momentum and complimented the government for sound management of the economy. “Accelerating GDP growth through higher investment in manufacturing and key infrastructure is the right strategy,” he said. “Sustaining this progress, however, will require an improved investment climate for the private sector, better revenue mobilization, and continued prudent macroeconomic management.”\n",

      "Mr. Amoako-Atta stated that the government of Ghana last year secured a Yen Loan for the development of a 54-meter cable-stayed bridge over the Volta River from Volivo to Dofor Adidome, and it is expected to form a critical part of the Eastern Corridor Development project.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“The bridge is a critical part of the Eastern Corridor Development, which is envisaged to become the main south-north corridor (because it is a shorter route to the northern sector compared to the central corridor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The bridge will serve as an alternative crossing point on the Volta River in any unforeseen circumstance that results in closure of the Adomi Bridge, as happened recently when the Adomi Bridge was closed down for rehabilitation. It is in this vein that the alternative crossing at Volivo and the by-pass road is vital,” the minister explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The detailed designs for the bridges and its implementation plans have all been duly completed, and are now awaiting an allocation of funds for the road component before actual commencement of works.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Japanese firm JICA, which is undertaking the bridge project, is also committed to the signed agreement with Ghana to develop the Asutuare Junction to Asikuma road concurrently with the bridge.\n",

      " ZIMBORDERS, a locally-owned company, has been awarded a US$100 million contract to rehabilitate the Beitbridge Border Post within 100 days, as President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s government targets to improve efficiency at the country’s busiest port of entry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Staff Writer\n",
      "\n",
      "The project was caught up in the massive Zanu PF factional fights during former president Robert Mugabe’s era with Mnangagwa’s faction and the G40 faction which had coalesced around former first lady Grace Mugabe having vested interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the Mnangagwa faction preferred Zimborders to carry out the project, the G40 faction preferred a South African company linked to controversial businessman Nikko Shefer. However, senior government officials told Zimbabwe Independent that Transport minister Joram Gumbo in December directed Zimborders to commence the project and complete it within 100 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Beitbridge rehabilitation will be done because Zimborders has been notified to commence operations,” a government official said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Zimborders won the tender in 2016 but cabinet then stopped the company from proceeding with its project.”\n",
      "\n",
      "During his 2018 budget presentation, Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa said the Beitbridge Border Post will be re-ordered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Government acknowledges the need to ease entry and exit of tourists and travellers, improve trade facilitation and revenue collection efficiency at Beitbridge Port of Entry,” Chinamasa said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the longer term, this will also require large investment in new infrastructure facilities at the port of entry. In the interim, government has been working with the African Development Bank to improve exit and entry efficiencies using the existing facilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In this regard, the border post expert subsequently engaged, with the assistance of funding from the African Development Bank, has since concluded the final report to this effect.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Chinamasa also said government was implementing short-term measures, which include “full rollout of the Electronic Cargo Tracking System, connection of electronic manifest control system to the ASYCUDA World Server, harmonisation of Container Depot operations to 24 hours in line with the border post’s operating hours, connection of mobile scanners to ASYCUDA World Server in order to enable real time entry and timely acquittal of goods.”\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Chinamasa, government will also prioritise the relocation of passenger buses carrying commercial cargo to a transit shed for purposes of clearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This assists to provide convenience to travellers with nothing to declare, implementation of the e-customs initiative for the advance clearance and online payment of relevant charges for tourist motor vehicles.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2015, Chinamasa said Zimbabwe needed US$100 million for construction and repair of the border to enable it to meet international standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Transport Ministry officials told the Independent the rehabilitation work will also include the construction of a new bridge, rehabilitation of the weighbridge and upgrading of communication and security systems. The project also includes the upgrading of the road network to and from the bridge, installing gate control infrastructure and erecting a perimeter fence around the post. Other facilities to be upgraded include the parking areas, commercial centre and staff accommodation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The border post will also be computerised and have its lighting systems upgraded. Systems which will enable the implementation of measures to strengthen collaboration between the South African Revenue Service and the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) through the harmonisation of customs systems and procedures at the border post, will also be installed at the border.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beitbridge Border Post is one of the busiest inland ports in sub-Saharan Africa and links the northern and southern corridors with a record 500 vehicles and 10 000 travellers passing through the port daily.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the port lacks soft and hard infrastructure that includes information technology and inspection bays, among others, to deal with high volumes of traffic have resulted in a lot of inconvenience to travellers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Travellers spend between six and 18 hours at the port of entry to complete immigration and customs formalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clearance of commercial traffic can take up to three days. The border is one of the most porous in the entire region, something which has made Zimbabwe’s counterpart in South Africa uneasy.\n",
