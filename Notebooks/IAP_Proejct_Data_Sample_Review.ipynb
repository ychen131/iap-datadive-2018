      "Community Health and SafetyThe Abidjan shopping mall is located in an urban area, and adjacent to a school. To increase traffic safety during operation, CFAO Retail built a small access road in front of the shopping mall and installed signage limiting speed around it.To address potential fire and life safety risks, CFAO Retail used French Standards for the Abidjan project. For each development, SGI shall provide a formal statement from a suitably qualified fire safety professional acceptable to IFC that the life and fire safety-related aspects of the building and fire safety system designs meet all local life and fire safety regulations and an internationally-accepted life safety code.  Following completion of construction and before public opening of any mall, SGI shall provide a second certification from a suitably qualified professional acceptable to IFC that the building and its fire safety systems were constructed according to the previously verified design or alternatively identify corrective features needed for design compliance and an implementation timeline.Security PersonnelAt the time of appraisal, security arrangements had already been made for the Abidjan site during construction with 26 non armed guards posted during the day and 11 during the night, and hired by a private security agency (G4S). CFAO Retail has also 20 staff directly responsible for surveillance of the shopping mall, CCTV management, and access control. CFAO Retail and G4S make reasonable inquiries to ensure that those providing security are not implicated in past abuses. The security agency trains agents adequately in the use of force and self-defense, fire safety, and appropriate conduct toward workers and Affected Communities; and require them to act within the applicable law.\n",
